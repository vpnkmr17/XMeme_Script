So,Here i have created a X-mem Web app

It takes three input from the user i.e: name,caption and url
It is able to Get the request from the server
It is able to Post the request from the server
It is able to Update the Meme
It shows error when someone tries to post the same meme again

For backend,I have used Django Rest Framework(DRF)
For Frontend,I have used HTML,CSS,Javascript

I have deployed the backend on Heroku
Here is the link:https://x-meme-s.herokuapp.com

And deployed the frontend on Netlify
